title:      With Low Power comes great responsibility
date:       2017-12-8
summary:    Low power communications and the need for devices to keep on going on coin cells is driving providing 
            application development. I ll talk about existing simulation techniques,
            pit-falls, and then introduce Whitefield-framework I developed.

Responsibility:
1. Remember, its not only you in the network. Be responsible, take care of your peers.
2. Transmit only when you are transmitted to.
3. Thou shall test in real networks, before you commit your numbers.
4. Thou shall STRIDE to secure.

Low power communications are becoming main stream. It's like going back to 80s but with hyper-charged applications who want to slurp whatever bandwidth comes to it. Well I was not born in 80s 

Design techniques:
1. Optimal Radio Duty Cycling
2. Wake up Radio
3. Low power transmission

802.15.4
BLE
WiFi HaLo
NB-IoT


#### NS3


#### Omnet++/Castalia

#### Why I decided to work on Whitefield-Framework?
